{ Command IDs

  Commands trigger actions in Visual Studio Code.

  If you have ever configured a keybinding, then you've worked with commands.

  Commands are also used by extensions to expose functionality to users, bind to actions in VS Code's UI, and implement internal logic

   await vscode.commands.executeCommand('interactive.history.previous');
   
      -> File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
          -> Copy Command Id 


    export function getCommands(filterInternal?: boolean): Thenable<string[]>;
}

@RegisterAction
class MoveUp extends BaseMovement {
